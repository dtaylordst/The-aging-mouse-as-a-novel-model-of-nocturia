Code for analyzing the Detursor tissue cellular expression data. 
After running CZI images as tiffues through our image J pipeline, the images are imported into cell profiler and analyzed using another custom script. 
The data used in this Detrusor code is from the "expanded_nuclei.csv" exported from the analyzed cell profiler data
This code runs statistcal analysis and creates plots of the percentages of gene expression per cell for each gene type.
